`Bite-sized additions to your word pantry â€” enjoy delicious discourse, everyday`


## How It Works

1. Login to your profile to enjoy all the wonderful words in our buffet!
1. Click any word in our Bulk Bin to see a detailed description.
1. Add any Single Serving word to your pantry (or remove it if you're bored of the taste).
1. See other chefs' use that word in a sentence with their custom "recipes" or add your own!
1. Don't worry if you don't like your recipe. You can delete if from the Single Serving page at any time.
1. You can also view the pantry of others chefs to check out what words they have stored for future use. It's a great place to get inspiration!
1. Keep an eye on the left side of the Bulk Bin page for realtime alerts of other chefs adding new words. You might see something you like.
1. When you're done, logout to protect your pantry and enjoy a verbose day filled with new word-treats.
